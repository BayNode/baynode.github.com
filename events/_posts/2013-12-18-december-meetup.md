Our December meetup will be happening on Wednesday, December 18th, 2013 at Silicon Valley Pad (1370 Willow Road, 2nd Floor, Menlo Park, CA).  Look for 'Menlo Science & Technology Park' and take the first left once you have turned off of Willow Road.


We'll kick things off at 7pm and should wrap up by 9pm.

Ross Kukulinski (@rosskukulinski of ASTI Labs) is going to talk about making technical decisions based on metrics from NodeJS applications using StatsD and Graphite.

Adam Crabtree (@CrabDude of LinkedIn) will be doing a lightning talk on domains and trycatch (an asynchronous domain-based exception handler)

Charlie Robbins (@indexzero of Nodejitsu) will be discussing how the internal architecture of the public npm registry is changing after the success of the #scalenpm crowd funding campaign. 

Everyone is welcome - including newcomers to node.js, those interested to hear what the hype is about, and experienced developers looking to trade tricks.
