Our March lightning-talk meetup will be happening on Wednesday, March 5th, 2014 at Silicon Valley Pad (1370 Willow Road, 2nd Floor, Menlo Park, CA).  Look for 'Menlo Science & Technology Park' and take the first left once you have turned off of Willow Road.

We'll kick things off at 7pm, and should wrap up by 9pm.

We have an open call for talks - please submit a lightning proposal to the [BayNode GitHub](https://github.com/BayNode/BayNode)


Everyone is welcome to attend: newcomers to node.js, those interested to hear what the hype is about, and experienced developers looking to trade tricks.
